## Introduction
In an analytic pipeline, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an important step before formal modelling. EDA helps 
determine relationships between variables and summarize their main characteristics often by means of data visualization. 

This episode focuses on  EDA of outbreaks and epidemic data, and how to achieved that using a couples of handy `R` 
packages. A key observation in EDA of epidemic analysis is capturing the relationship between time and the number of 
reported cases, spanning various categories (confirmed, hospitalized, deaths, and recoveries), locations, and other 
demographic factors such as gender, age, etc.  
 
## Synthetic outbreak data
To illustrate the process of conducting EDA on outbreak data, we will generate a line list 
for a hypothetical Ebola outbreak utilizing the `{simulist}` package. This line list dataset offers individual-level 
information about the outbreak. For our simulation, we will assume that the dynamics of this outbreak are influenced by 
several factors: the contact distribution (average number of contacts for an infected case), distribution of contact 
intervals (time period between contacts), and the delay distributions of onset to hospitalization and onset to death. 
These latter distributions can be sourced from literature and are conveniently available in the `{epiparameter}` 
package, see the below code chunk.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
requireNamespace("simulist", quietly = TRUE)
requireNamespace("epiparameter", quietly = TRUE)
contact_dist <- epiparameter::epidist(
  disease = "Ebola",
  epi_dist = "contact distribution",
  prob_distribution = "pois",
  prob_distribution_params = c(mean = 4)
)
cont_interval <- epiparameter::epidist(
  disease = "Ebola",
  epi_dist = "contact interval",
  prob_distribution = "gamma",
  prob_distribution_params = c(shape = 1, scale = 1)
)
# Define onset to hospitalized
onset_to_hosp <- contact_dist <- epiparameter::epidist(
  disease = "Ebola",
  epi_dist = "onset to hospitalisatio",
  prob_distribution = "pois",
  prob_distribution_params = c(mean = 14)
)

# get onset to death from {epiparameter} database
onset_to_death <- epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "Ebola",
  epi_dist = "onset to death",
  single_epidist = TRUE
)
infect_period <- epiparameter::epidist(
  disease = "Ebola",
  epi_dist = "Infectious period",
  prob_distribution = "gamma",
  prob_distribution_params = c(shape = 1, scale = 1)
)
```
Additionally, we assume that the outbreak started at the beginning of 2023, is highly contagious with a probability of 
infection of 80%, and its minimum and maximum sizes are 1000 and 10,000, respectively. Combining these assumptions with 
the mentioned distributions, the code chunk below generates a simulated line list:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
base::set.seed(1)
linelist <- simulist::sim_linelist(
  contact_dist,
  infect_period,
  prob_infect = 0.8,
  onset_to_hosp,
  onset_to_death,
  hosp_risk = 0.2,
  hosp_death_risk = 0.5,
  non_hosp_death_risk = 0.05,
  outbreak_start_date = as.Date("2023-01-01"),
  add_names = TRUE,
  add_ct = TRUE,
  outbreak_size = c(1000, 10000),
  population_age = c(1, 90),
  case_type_probs = c(suspected = 0.2, probable = 0.1, confirmed = 0.7),
  config = simulist::create_config()
)
utils::head(linelist)
```
## Aggregating
Downstream analysis involves working with aggregated data rather than individual cases. This requires grouping linelist 
data in the form of incidence data. The [incidence2]((https://www.reconverse.org/incidence2/articles/incidence2.html){.external target="_blank"}) 
package offers an essential function, called `incidence`, for grouping case data, usually centered around dated events 
and/or other factors. The code chunk provided below demonstrates the creation of an `incidence2` object from the 
`covid19_eng_case_data` based on the sampling date.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
requireNamespace("incidence2", quietly = TRUE)
incidence_data <- incidence2::incidence(
  linelist,
  date_index = "date_onset",
  interval = 1
)
utils::head(incidence_data, 5)
```
## visualization
The `incidence2` object can be visualized using the `plot()` function from base R package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)
requireNamespace("tracetheme", quietly = TRUE)
base::plot(incidence_data) + ggplot2::labs(
  x = "Time (in days)",
  y = "Dialy cases"
) + tracetheme::theme_trace()
``` 


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `{simulist}` to generate synthetic outbreak data
- Use `{incidence2}` to aggregate and visualize case data based on a date event.
